      <img src="../Basic-Portfolio/assets/images/headshot.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Eki Taula">

      <p>My name is Eddie Taula, but most people call me "Eki". "Eki" is "Eddie" in the Samoan language. "Eti" is technically "Eddie" in Samoan, but in the Samoan language "t"s can be substituted for "k"s. I've been married for 15 years to my beautiful wife Lori and we have 2 wonderful children, our daughter Mariah (age 20) and son Mosiah (age 7). I'm a working musician, piano and voice teacher, and student at UMKC Conservatory of Music and Dance. I have a voice and piano studio comprised of 20 students. I sing and play all genres from Pop to Rythm and Blues to Classical. The music I most enjoy to sing is Opera.</p>
